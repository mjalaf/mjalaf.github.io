My name is Martin Jalaf, I am Solution Architect working at Microsoft, before Microsoft I took several roles like Software Engineer, Functional Analyst and Team Lead. I am living in Chile, South America but I was born in Argentina. 

My areas of expertise are Application Development and infrastructure. Since 2013, I started working with cloud Technologies but mainly on Azure. 

When I am not working, I love to spend time with my family and friends.  In 2016, I joined to a Running Club in Argentina and since then I continue running but now in a trail running club in Chile. I have two more hobbies - Football Soccer and Photography, I am not good on any of those, but I enjoy watching football matches or taking photos....
